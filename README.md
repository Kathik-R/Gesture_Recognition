# Gesture_Recognition_Drone
The plan is to execute the idea in three stages

STAGE 1: Build a PIXHAWK Microprocessor based drone that can execute predetermined flight objectives. (STATUS- Complete)

STAGE 2: Use Microbits and MicroPython code to move from a remote controller to a hand movement based control. (STATUS- Work in Progress)

STAGE 3: Use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to enable the drone to react to hand gestures and act accordingly. (STATUS- Yet to begin)
